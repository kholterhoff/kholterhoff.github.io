Students will create posters evaluating an adaptation of one Victorian text into a new medium. Individuals will read and compare one 19th century fiction with a 20 or 21st century adaptation. Posters will highlight one or two significant similarities and differences and use these specific examples to support a claim about the thematic significance of these adaptations. For instance, a poster comparing Charlotte Bronte's _Jane Eyre_ (1847) to <a href="http://theautobiographyofja.wixsite.com/jane-eyre">_The Autobiography of Jane Eyre: a web series_</a> might suggest that Jane's relationship to literature is essential to this _bildungsroman_. In a poster comparing Arthur Conan Doyle’s “A Scandal in Bohemia” (1891) to the _Sherlock_ episode “A Scandal in Belgravia” (2012), students might argue that both texts offer interrogations of the role of women in British culture. By juxtaposing screen caps of Irene Adler from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942612/mediaviewer/rm1463989248">_Sherlock_</a> with the illustration <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=83xHAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q&f=false">"The Photograph"</a> by Sidney Paget.

Posters must highlight the mediums deployed in each text. How do viewers relate to the visual elements in an illustrated text as compared to a Television show? How does the Victorians' experience reading triple-decker novels borrowed from Mudie's Lending Library differ from a contemporary viewer's experience watching a webseries? Posters should include some background about the author and summary about the 19th century text as well a broad history of the adaptation of this text. Students should conduct outside research to support their claim. 


<h3>Goals</h3>

This assignment challenges students in three ways:

* First, it asks students to summarize information and create a compelling visual narrative that will inform and persuade an audience.
* Second, it asks students to demonstrate an awareness of and ability to use basic principles of visual design.
* Third, it asks students to synthesize multiple texts and distill an argument about what connects them.


<h3>Technology/Logistics</h3>

Students should select from several different software options to create their posters:

* PowerPoint
* Adobe InDesign (available in the multimedia lab), see Lynda.com tutorials.
* Adobe Illustrator (There are tutorials at Lynda, and also on the web. See, for example, this one, which has a focused emphasis on posters)
* GIMP (free) or Adobe Photoshop (Again, see Lynda for tutorials)
* An online tool, such as Piktochart or Canva.

I suggest you review the section in WOVEN Text covering “Charts/ Infographics” (pp. 355-358).


<h3>Submission/ printing for gallery style viewing</h3>

Each student will print their poster so that we can do a gallery style viewing in class. These posters will be collected and assessed by the instructor. 

<a href="http://www.undergradresearch.gatech.edu/poster-printing">There are plotters in the Multimedia Studio and at Paper and Clay in the Student Center (3rd floor) that will allow you to print your poster</a>. The large format plotter can print 24”, 36”, and 42” inches wide and any length. The pricing is per linear foot $2.50, $2.75, and $3.00, respectively. Choose your size accordingly. You may orient your poster either vertically or horizontally.

Give yourself plenty of time to print your poster. Students often discover that there’s a line at the plotter and that it actually takes a long time to print even when it is their turn. Also, if you were to use a print shop (such as Paper and Clay), some require you to submit your file 48 hours in advance. You may wish to print extra copies at the time you print to keep copies for yourself.

<h5>Tips</h5>

* You should choose a size for your poster based on your reactions to other posters you find on the web. Many poster are tall images; others go for something wider. It’s not important that the image be any specific size: more important is what it can do for a viewer in a short timespan (you should anticipate that viewers will spend 1-2 minutes with your poster.
* Include a clear title somewhere in your poster. It should be specific and attention-grabbing.
* Somewhere in the poster, include your name
* Cite all sources using MLA at the bottom of the poster.


<h3> Supporting Document </h3>

Along with your poster, you will submit a 2-3 page (1,000 word) supporting document that addresses, explains, and supports the choices you have made in your poster. You should address not only the argument that your poster engages but also why you’ve chosen this particular topic. You should also address/explain your choice of style, font, color, images, size, etc., How do your choices of design elements work together to convey your topic/argument/point? Why did you choose these particular elements as opposed to something else? Why did you choose this topic? Who or what organization might use your poster in a real world setting?


<h3>Timeline</h3>

* Monday TBD: Tutorial with Allison Valk
* Wednesday 2/8- Friday 2/10: Presentations & Gallery Viewing (bring printed posters to class for viewing)
* Monday 2/13: Revised Digital version of poster (use JPG, PDF, or TIFF), Annotated Bibliography, and Supporting Document Due on T-Square at midnight. Email is also an acceptable way to submit these documents.


<h3>Reflection</h3>

* Reflect upon your strengths and weaknesses in completing the project.
* Describe the methods and modes that were the focus of your communicative work in the project.
* Articulate areas and strategies you would like to focus on for continued improvement.
* What is your argument or purpose, and how did you make the argument or purpose visible in your artifact?
* Who is the intended audience for your artifact, and why? How is your choice of audience reflected in your artifact?
* What are the defining features of the genre or media that you are using in this project, and how do you make use of these features?
