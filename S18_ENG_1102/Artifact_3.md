Students in groups of 4 or 5 will formulate a research question and create a data visualization using a periodical from <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/">HathiTrust</a>. With the help of Georgia Tech's Data Visualization Librarian <a href="http://libguides.gatech.edu/prf.php?account_id=139382">Ximin Mi</a> (<a href="mailto:ximin.mi@library.gatech.edu">ximin.mi@library.gatech.edu</a>), students will build upon the skills gained in Artifact #2 by using data sets to make arguments about literary history and culture. Unlike the close reading assignments practiced in Artifacts #1 and #2, students will practice distant reading numerous Victorian periodicals in order to make claims. Students will present their findings in the form of a coherent, well-designed, and easily comprehensible data visualization.

This assignment is an exercise in <a href="https://newleftreview.org/II/1/franco-moretti-conjectures-on-world-literature#_edn6">**Distant Reading**</a>, a phrase coined by Franco Moretti to distinguish a way of studying literature that privilidges quantitative rather than qualitative research. As Moretti explains, "the trouble with close reading (in all of its incarnations, from the new criticism to deconstruction) is that it necessarily depends on an extremely small canon...you invest so much in individual texts only if you think that very few of them really matter...Distant reading: where distance, let me repeat it, _is a condition of knowledge_: it allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes—or genres and systems. And if, between the very small and the very large, the text itself disappears, well, it is one of those cases when one can justifiably say, Less is more. If we want to understand the system in its entirety, we must accept losing something."


<h3>What is Data Visualization?</h3>

According to Andy Kirk’s <a href="http://seeingdata.org/">Seeing Data</a>, funded by the Arts & Humanities Research Council and hosted by the University of Sheffield,

"Visualisations aim to help people make sense of and explore data. Experts believe representing data in visual ways can help communicate what the data means. It can also allow people the opportunity to analyse and examine large datasets, which would otherwise be difficult to understand." (<a href="http://seeingdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-is-data-visualisation-transcript.pdf">“What is Data Visualization”</a>)

<h3>Goals</h3>

This assignment challenges students in four ways:

* First, it asks students to understand and use the conventions of metadata creation for images.
* Second, it asks students to think and write critically about the categorization and visualization of large datasets.
* Third, it asks students to apply course themes to the analysis of fiction.
* Fourth, it asks students to coordinate decisions and execute them as a group.


<h3>Visualization</h3>

Once groups collect their data sets from Hathitrust, and organize their findings in order to answer their questions they will use this data to create a visualization. I suggest students review visualization types and options using Douglas Armstrong’s D3 Gallery on Github, Andy Kirk’s Visualising Data, and A Periodic Table of Visualization Methods. Be creative and brainstorm as many visualization ideas and hypotheses as possible. Each visualization will have a different header (stating your thesis), and will grapple with different portions of the data. Keep the acronym ASK in mind during this process (Accuracy, Story, Knowledge). Although your visualization should be Accurate, think about the different types of Stories and the different forms of Knowledge your visualization might create. While groups should try out several options as part of their process, each team must determine which visualization works best and be able to explain why.

Visualizations are arguments about datasets. Creating visualizations will enable groups to think both critically and creatively about the implications of their metadata. An important component of this artifact is justifying how to make sense of their data in order to identify pertinent trends and patterns.

Because descriptive metadata tags are always subjective interpretations, each group must justify the decisions they make for creating and visualizing their information. For example, if the same illustration appears in several editions, groups will have to decide if the tags accompanying this image should be counted multiple times in a visualization. Moreover, because each novel has a complex and distinctive graphic history, groups should come up with strategies to visualize their text’s content in unique ways. If full-page illustrations tend to have different tags than illustrations embedded in the text, consider using your visualization to compare these illustration types. Visualizations might also identify how the tags associated with illustrations created by multiple artists differ.

Visualizations must include:

Header (mention illustration, title of book, and possibly Haggard and the illustrator’s name)
Legend stating pertinent explanatory information; the data’s source (Visual Haggard, others?); and creators (names of group members).


<h3>Supporting Document </h3>

As a group, reflect on the process of creating your visualizations in a 2-3 page (1,000 word) supporting statement. How did your teammates decide which visualization reveals the most interesting argument? What did your group notice about the dataset? What were the major differences between your several visualizations? What argument does this dataset allow you to make about the illustrations created to accompany Haggard’s novel? What patterns do you notice in these illustrations?

<h3>Timeline</h3>

* Wednesday TBD: In-Design Tutorial. Meet in Homer Rice Room.
* Friday TBD: Pick your Victorian text <a href="">Section A4</a>; <a href="">Section B7</a>; <a href="">Section HP2</a>.
* Monday TBD during class: Have your spreadsheet list of illustration tags completed for class.
* Wednesday TBD during class: Bring a digital copy of at least one data visualization to project on the screen, and discuss with the class. Samples should be as complete as possible (include header, scale, color, etc.). Teams will explain the decisions they made in creating this data visualization verbally.
* Friday, 4/13: Complete Project due.


<h3>Reflection</h3>

* What were the main intellectual goals of the assignment? Please situate these goals in terms of the course theme and in terms of the communication strategies you were to learn or practice.
* What is your argument or purpose? How did you make the argument or purpose visible and persuasive in your artifact?
* Who is the intended audience for your artifact? Why is this an appropriate audience? How is your choice of audience reflected in your artifact?
* What are the defining features of the genre or media that you are using in this project? How do you makeuse of these features?
* If you had more time for revision, what would you change and why?
