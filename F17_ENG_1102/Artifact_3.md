Students, in groups of 5 or 6, will select one Steampunk video game from the list below to play from start to finish. Only one group may select any of the games on this list. Groups will compose an approximately 7-minute video essay synthesizing one or several of the course themes using the game as evidence for this analysis. Although the topic is open, make sure that your project is not merely a review and summary of the game. Your film’s viewers should have little sense as to whether or not you liked the game. Rather, this video essay will critique what ideological and narrative work this game accomplishes. Projects should attend particularly to the role of interactive story lines and the manner in which the game’s input device alters the user's experience.
 
 
<h3>Video Essay</h3>
A video essay is a brief video created by joining video footage and slides on a specific topic and narrating the connections in order to generate novel insights. Like a written essay, these videos should have a clearly stated thesis, strong and well-argued sections, logical transitions, and a Works Cited (at least five scholarly sources). The film footage in your project must come predominantly from your game. Groups must conduct outside research and cite a minimum of five secondary sources in addition to the primary source of the selected game. Each team member should narrate some portion of the video. In short, I want to hear every group member's voice. Final videos may be uploaded to Vimeo or YouTube, or T-Square.

<h3>Goals</h3>

This assignment challenges you four ways:

* First, it asks you to analyze critical and historical themes in a new media source and generate a compelling argument that will persuade an audience.
* Second, it asks you to demonstrate your awareness of and ability to use basic principles of written, oral, visual, electronic, and non-verbal communication and design.
* Third, it asks you to coordinate decisions and execute them as a group. Review Chapter 8, "Collaborating Cooperatively" of WOVENText (165-175).
* Fourth, it requires you to generate and distill substantive research on a topic.

 
<h3>Technology</h3>
I recommend <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>, a free and open source software for recording your gameplay. Final videos must be saved as MP4 files.

All voice-overs must use a professional microphone. Do not use the built-in microphones on your laptops or cameras.

You can rent Audio/ Visual equipment on the GaTech campus through the Library's <a href="http://libguides.gatech.edu/gadgets">Gadgets</a>; <a href="https://design.gatech.edu/audiovisual-equipment">the College of Design</a>; or <a href="https://www.ssc.gatech.edu/node/38">the Bill Moore Student Success Center</a>.


<h3>Considerations Before Selecting a Game</h3>

* How much time do you want to devote to gameplay? These games range in playtime between roughly two and ten hours, but this may vary depending on your familiarity with video games. If you are concerned about the time commitment, I highly recommend you choose a point-and-click game that requires no expertise.
* What game rating and subject matter is your entire group comfortable with? Games like _Assassin's Creed Syndicate_ are rated M, for mature, owing to language, violence, and sexual explicitness.
* How much are you willing to spend on a game? Some games on this list are free like _Bang! Howdy_, while others, like _Dishonored 2_, cost around forty dollars on Steam.

<h4>Alternate Games</h4>
If your group would like to suggest a narrative-driven game I am open to other games. Email proposals for different games to me by TBD at midnight. Proposals must offer a compelling argument for why you feel it fulfills the goals of this assignment. If I reject your proposal you will still have an opportunity to select from the provided list of games at the same time as your peers.


<h3>Annotated Bibliography</h3>

Students must research and write annotated bibliographies for at least five secondary sources. This is a joint, co-authored bibliography. You should use these annotations to determine what belongs in your video essay, and what doesn’t.

I suggest you review Chapter 20 in WOVEN Text covering “Process: Integrating and Documenting Sources” (pp. 776-796).

 
<h3>Time Line</h3>

* October TBD at 1:00 PM: Submit Proposals for Alternative Games if desired. I will respond that evening.
* October TBD at 1:00 PM: Video Games Form Released. Select a game no later than TBD at 11:59 PM.
* November TBD: Each group should record a small section of your team's video game (30-60 seconds). Bring this video clip of your game to discuss during class. Think of this segment as an opportunity for close reading.
* November TBD: Script for Video due in class. Bring 6-7 print copies (enough for every person in your group, plus one for your instructor).
* November TBD: <a href="http://info.catme.org/">Login to CATME to complete your  Artifact #3 Peer Assessment.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLTBtksrTFY">Here is a helpful video guide for student users  explaining CATME Online Peer Assessment.</a>
