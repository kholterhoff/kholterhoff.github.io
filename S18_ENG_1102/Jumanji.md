1) What is the jungle? Why do suburban, American teenagers need it? What happens to Westerners in jungles?
2) Why does the adventure fiction genre intersect so well with video games (or games more broadly)? _Tomb Raider_, _Uncharted_
3) What is the moral of _Jumanji_? 
4) The Jumanji jungle is set ambiguously in the past, but what time period is it? Do clothes, weapons, transportation give us any clues?
5) What does the jewel “Jaguar's Eye” symbolize? 
6) Why are the 4 teenagers in reality balanced in their gender identities, but in the game there is only 1 token gorgeous woman? Are the screen writers satirizing gender in gamer culture?
7) Why is it important to have many of the game characters be specialists in academically rigorous subjects like zoology, cartography, and archaeology?
8) What people are native to the jungle? Traders in the bazaar? NPCs?
