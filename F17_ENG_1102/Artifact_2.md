Students will create posters evaluating an adaptation of one Victorian text into a new medium. Individuals will read and compare one 19th century fiction with a 20 or 21st century adaptation. Posters will highlight one or two significant similarities and differences and use these specific examples to support a claim about the thematic significance of these adaptations. 

For instance, a poster comparing Charlotte Bronte's _Jane Eyre_ (1847) to <a href="http://theautobiographyofja.wixsite.com/jane-eyre">_The Autobiography of Jane Eyre: a web series_</a> might suggest that Jane's relationship to literature is essential to this _bildungsroman_. In a poster comparing Arthur Conan Doyle’s “A Scandal in Bohemia” (1891) to the _Sherlock_ episode “A Scandal in Belgravia” (2012), students might argue that both texts offer interrogations of the role of women in British culture by juxtaposing screen caps of Irene Adler from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942612/mediaviewer/rm1463989248">_Sherlock_</a> with the illustration <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=83xHAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q&f=false">"The Photograph"</a> by Sidney Paget.

You may select any Victorian text (published between 1837-1901) for this project _except_ ones we study as a class (_Alice in Wonderland_, "A Scandal in Bohemia," _The String of Pearls_). <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iayHf79wIxH0s5pZ-g9sWjVaKGbanjtJns5N7kdBBlo/edit?usp=sharing">Need some ideas for texts?</a> I encourage you to choose a Sherlock Holmes story written by A.C. Doyle (any publication date is acceptable in this case). However, only one student per section may select any text. You may sign up for specific Sherlock Holmes Stories beginning at 9:00 am on Friday, 9/15: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxBPCAo4t4TzF6Siv_pt1UGSJ3EFXy91MAX6GSx-aLszzFMg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Section A3</a>; <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDluiXLsrQzOpvMFsFoEy8y8t6H4IKWe1x1nkH2bf9J4jffQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Section J</a>; <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdINoGdN4PTE4Xtrl2eomzihRvt6q3POY9lI2U_HbHIgeOPuw/viewform?usp=sf_link">Section G3</a>. If the Sherlock Holmes story that you want is missing from the drop-down menu then another student has already claimed it and you must pick a different one.

Posters must highlight the mediums deployed in each text. How do viewers relate to the visual elements in an illustrated text as compared to a Television show? How does the Victorians' experience reading triple-decker novels borrowed from Mudie's Lending Library differ from a contemporary viewer's experience watching a webseries? Posters should include some background about the author and summary about the 19th century text as well a broad history of the adaptation of this text. Students should conduct outside research to support their claim. 


<h3>Goals</h3>

This assignment challenges students in three ways:

* First, it asks students to summarize information and create a compelling visual narrative that will inform and persuade an audience.
* Second, it asks students to demonstrate an awareness of and ability to use basic principles of visual design.
* Third, it asks students to synthesize multiple texts and distill an argument about what connects them.


<h3>Technology/Logistics</h3>

Students should select from several different software options to create their posters:

* PowerPoint
* Adobe InDesign (available in the multimedia lab), see Lynda.com tutorials.
* Adobe Illustrator (There are tutorials at Lynda, and also on the web. See, for example, this one, which has a focused emphasis on posters)
* GIMP (free) or Adobe Photoshop (Again, see Lynda for tutorials)
* An online tool, such as Piktochart or Canva.

I suggest you review the section in WOVEN Text covering “Charts/ Infographics” (pp. 355-358).


<h3>Submission/ printing for gallery style viewing</h3>

Each student will print their poster so that we can do a gallery style viewing in class. These posters will be collected and assessed by the instructor. 

<a href="http://www.undergradresearch.gatech.edu/poster-printing">There are plotters in the Multimedia Studio and at Paper and Clay in the Student Center (3rd floor) that will allow you to print your poster</a>. The large format plotter can print 24”, 36”, and 42” inches wide and any length. The pricing is per linear foot $2.50, $2.75, and $3.00, respectively. Choose your size accordingly. You may orient your poster either vertically or horizontally.

Give yourself plenty of time to print your poster. Students often discover that there’s a line at the plotter and that it actually takes a long time to print even when it is their turn. Also, if you were to use a print shop (such as Paper and Clay), some require you to submit your file 48 hours in advance. You may wish to print extra copies at the time you print to keep copies for yourself.

<h5>Tips</h5>

* You should choose a size for your poster based on your reactions to other posters you find on the web. Many poster are tall images; others go for something wider. It’s not important that the image be any specific size: more important is what it can do for a viewer in a short timespan (you should anticipate that viewers will spend 1-2 minutes with your poster.
* Include a clear title somewhere in your poster. It should be specific and attention-grabbing.
* Somewhere in the poster, include your name
* Cite all sources using MLA at the bottom of the poster.


<h3> Supporting Document </h3>

Along with your poster, you will submit a 2-page (approximately 1,000 word) supporting document that addresses, explains, and supports the choices you have made in your poster. You should address not only the argument that your poster engages but also why you’ve chosen this particular topic. You should also address/explain your choice of style, font, color, images, size, etc., How do your choices of design elements work together to convey your topic/argument/point? Why did you choose these particular elements as opposed to something else? Why did you choose this topic? Who or what organization might use your poster in a real world setting?
