Students will create and justify illustrations and data sets to accompany one novel by H. Rider Haggard. To complete this artifact students will select one of Haggard’s novels from the list below to read outside of class. They will then write descriptive metadata for each of the images associated with this novel archived on <a href="www.visualhaggard.org">Visual Haggard: The Illustration Archive</a>. These tags must conform to the standards and conventions established during class discussion, and in secondary sources like <a href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html">the Library of Congress Subject Headings</a>; <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/">the J. Paul Getty Trust’s Categories for the Description of Works of Art</a>, and <a href="http://vraweb.org/">the Visual Resources Association</a>. Students will then use this dataset create a new illustration. Finally, students will write a statement (1,000 words) reflecting on the assignment and explaining what quantitative data sets reveal to be the most compelling, surprising, and/ or historically significant argument that their data reveals.


<h2>Goals</h2>

This assignment challenges students in three ways:

* First, it asks students to understand and use the conventions of metadata creation for images.
* Second, it asks students to think and write critically about the categorization and significance of large datasets.
* Third, it asks students to apply course themes to the analysis of fiction.


<h2>H. Rider Haggard Novel & Illustrations</h2>

Students will select and read novels written by H. Rider Haggard. The text of these novels is freely available on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, and/or <a href="https://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>. While reading these texts, I suggest that students use the illustration archive _Visual Haggard_ to experience these books graphically. Because illustrations were meant to be seen as the plot progressed it is unwise to reserve seeing them to a later time.


<h4>List of Books</h4>

* _Ayesha_
* _Allan and the Holy Flower_
* _Allan Quatermain_

<h2>Descriptive Metadata Tags</h2>

Using Microsoft Excel or <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a>, students will create a spreadsheet listing all the illustrations available on _Visual Haggard_ for their assigned novel. Students will write descriptive tags for each of these illustrations.

<h4>Information to Include in Tags:</h4>

* All objects in the illustration (window, horse, hat, tree)
* Setting (Continent, Country, House, Forest)
* Full names of characters depicted
* Posture and expression of characters
* Critical themes: Race, Gender, Religion
* Style of art
* Number of human figures (e.g. 1 figure, 3 figures, crowd)


<h3>Collage and Paper Circuit Illustration</h3>

Students will create visual interpretations of a selection of text based on a pattern identified in their data sets. Using Open Refine students will identify patterns in the datasets they write. These might include the number times a male protagonist appears in a standing position compared to the female protagonist. These illustrations should reimagine and push-back on Haggard’s text and possibly an illustrator’s interpretation of it (Satire, Remix). For instance, a re-mix might reverse the gender roles depicted in the nineteenth-century illustrations by showing the female characters in a standing position. You should not simply copy an existing illustration, but rather reinvent it. The best projects will demonstrate 1) planning, 2) time, and 3) an interesting and thoughtful intervention in Haggard’s text.

Before beginning your design, decide what elements must be included in this illustration (characters, plot, scenery). How should these elements be arranged? Could you illustrate this scene in order to make a political statement? What strategies might you use to critique Haggard’s attitudes in regards to race, gender, religion, etc.? How could you update the scene for the modern-day? Illustrations can be as realistic or abstract and even non-objective as you choose. You should sketch out your plan before Friday, 4/7, so that you can devote the entire class period to making the illustration. In fact, you may wish to print out images to add to your collage.

As part of this course’s emphasis on digital humanities and electronic technologies, and thanks to funding through the Institute of Museum and Library Services’ Sparks! Ignition Grants for Libraries, these illustrations will include an interactive component. All illustrations must incorporate LED lights using the supplied materials. The artist Ashley Schick will give us a tutorial about creating paper circuits in class. Your instructor will provide all materials necessary for creating paper circuits (LED lights, copper tape, and batteries) as well as scissors, markers, pencils, art paper, and National Geographic Magazines.

This unit combines critical thinking with creativity. Students will have a large and varied number of resources to create interesting and beautiful illustrations.


<h3>Supporting Document </h3>

Reflect on the process of creating your visualizations in a 2-3 page (1,000 word) supporting statement. How did your teammates decide which visualization reveals the most interesting argument? What did your group notice about the dataset? What were the major differences between your several visualizations? What argument does this dataset allow you to make about the illustrations created to accompany Haggard’s novel? What patterns do you notice in these illustrations?


<h3>Timeline</h3>

* TBD: Open Refine Tutorial. Meet in Homer Rice Room.
* Friday TBD: Pick your Victorian text <a href="">Section A4</a>; <a href="">Section B7</a>; <a href="">Section HP2</a>.
* Monday TBD during class: Have your spreadsheet list of illustration tags completed for class.
* Wednesday
* Friday TBD: Complete Project due.


<h3>Reflection</h3>

* Reflect upon your strengths and weaknesses in completing the project.
* Describe the methods and modes that were the focus of your communicative work in the project.
* Articulate areas and strategies you would like to focus on for continued improvement.
* What is your argument or purpose, and how did you make the argument or purpose visible in your artifact?
* Who is the intended audience for your artifact, and why? How is your choice of audience reflected in your artifact?
* What are the defining features of the genre or media that you are using in this project, and how do you make use of these features?
