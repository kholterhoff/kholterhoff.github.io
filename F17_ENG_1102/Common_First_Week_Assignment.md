Create a video (60-90 seconds) in which you articulate a challenge relating to one of the modes—written, oral, visual, electronic, or nonverbal communication—that you’ll be engaging with in class projects this semester.

IMPORTANT: If you completed a similar video in a previous class (ENGL 1101 or ENGL 1102), you should create a new video that speaks to the class you are now in and the specific challenges you see in this course.
