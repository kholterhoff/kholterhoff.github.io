All students will be assigned to a group for this artifact. Groups will present on a secondary source related to our primary text. Your instructor will provide access to this source. Groups will sit in the front of the class and co-teach the day’s assigned reading and secondary source with the instructor for the entirety of the class period. Groups do not need to become an expert on their secondary source, but they must be able to speak about it in a thoughtful manner for the context of our course.


<h3>Student Presentations will be graded on the following criteria:</h3>

1)	Groups must design a handout, print enough copies for the class, and post the handout to our course management site. Handouts should summarize the assigned secondary source in a concise and clear manner, relate the source to overarching course themes and texts, and list at least three questions they identify as emerging from the text. 

2)	Presentations must use the course themes and key words to summarize, explain, and contextualize the secondary source for the class. By the end of the presentation the class should have a clear understanding of how this secondary source opens up new ways of thinking about WOVEN, fiction, and Victorians in Cyberspace.

3)	Presenters must generate thought-provoking questions to make their assigned reading accessible to peers. Although grades depend on the quality of the presenter’s exposition and handout, an excellent presentation should engage the class through a lively and creative discussion.
