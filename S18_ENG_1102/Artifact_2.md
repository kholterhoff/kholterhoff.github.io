Students, in groups of 5, will select one adventure film from the list below to watch. Only one group per section may select any of the movies on this list. Groups will compose an approximately 7 to 10-minute video essay synthesizing one or several of the course themes using the film as evidence for this analysis. Although the topic is open, make sure that your project is not merely a review and summary. Your audience includes not only the instructor and your classmates, but anyone on YouTube. Viewers should have little sense as to whether or not your team liked the movie. Rather, this video essay will emerge out of a research question to critique what ideological and narrative work this film accomplishes.
 
 
<h3>Video Essay</h3>
A video essay is a brief video created by joining video footage and slides on a specific topic and narrating the connections in order to generate novel insights. Like a written essay, these videos should have a clearly stated thesis, strong and well-argued sections, logical transitions, and a Works Cited (at least five scholarly sources). The film footage in your project must come predominantly from your game. Groups must conduct outside research and cite a minimum of five secondary sources in addition to the primary source of the selected game. Final videos must be uploaded to Vimeo or YouTube. Links to these projects, as well as supporting material, should be submitted through Canvas. Pick one team member to submit your team's materials.
 

<h4>Examples of Video Essays by Undergraduate Students</h4>

* Gatech student Sean Gedorio's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM7SibjbWNw">"Black Swan Video Essay Analysis"</a>
* Gatech students from Dr. Holterhoff's 1102 Course <a href="https://1102theliteratureofnewmedia.weebly.com/">The Literature of New Media</a> titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzI5dteVtCY">"Artifact 3- Her Story"</a>
 
<h3>Goals</h3>

This assignment challenges you four ways:

* First, it asks you to analyze critical and historical themes in a new media source and generate a compelling argument that will persuade an audience.
* Second, it asks you to demonstrate your awareness of and ability to use basic principles of written, oral, visual, electronic, and non-verbal communication and design.
* Third, it asks you to coordinate decisions and execute them as a group. Review Chapter 8, "Collaborating Cooperatively" of WOVENText (165-175).
* Fourth, it requires you to generate and distill substantive research on a topic.

 
<h3>Technology</h3>
I recommend using iMovie or <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>, a free and open source software for recording videos. Final videos must be saved as MP4 files.

All voice-overs must use a professional microphone. Do not use the built-in microphones on your laptops or cameras. If you record your own video, you must use a professional camera and lighting equipment.

You can rent Audio/ Visual equipment on the GaTech campus through the Library's <a href="http://libguides.gatech.edu/gadgets">Gadgets</a>; <a href="https://design.gatech.edu/audiovisual-equipment">the College of Design</a>; or <a href="https://www.ssc.gatech.edu/node/38">the Bill Moore Student Success Center</a>.

<h5>Alternate Films</h5>
If your group would like to suggest a different movie email proposals to me by TBD Proposals must offer a compelling argument for why you feel it fulfills the goals of this assignment. If I reject your proposal you will still have an opportunity to select from the provided list of films at the same time as your peers.


<h3>Links to Select Movie</h3>
* <a href="">Section A4</a>; <a href="">Section B7</a>; <a href="">Section HP2</a>.


<h3>Video Essay Script</h3>
Every group will bring a completed copy of their Video Essay script to class. Scripts should be written in polished prose, and not in outline form. This draft should be at least 4-pages in length (12 pt font, 1 inch margins, double spaced). Bring 6 print copies (enough for every person in your group, plus one for your instructor).

Although this script may be written as a regular essay, you may also want to include images and storyboard slides to indicate the visual evidence your group plans to pair with your words. If your team intends to have multiple speakers rather than one, consider identifying which team member will speak each section in the script.

Your essay should incorporate some preliminary research (2 secondary sources minimum). At the very least every team should Google their movie to see what the director or screen writer has to say about their intentions (if anything), and to get some sense of its reviews from critics. You should also Google important keywords. I suggest using sources from Artifact #1 (although sources from Artifact #1 are not eligible for the annotated bibliography).

This script is a first draft. Your peers and your instructor will review this script, and your team will implement revision suggestions before recording your final project. Seeing this script will afford your instructor with the opportunity to critique the quality your thesis, evidence, organization, and mechanics, so that you know what to improve before submitting your final video essay. I will be able to give the best feedback to those groups that bring in the most polished scripts.


<h3>Annotated Bibliography</h3>

Students must research and write annotated bibliographies for at least five secondary sources. At least three of these sources should be academic, meaning that they are published in peer-reviewed journals or books. This is a joint, co-authored bibliography. You should use these annotations to determine what belongs in your video essay, and what doesn’t.

I suggest you review Chapter 20 in WOVEN Text covering “Process: Integrating and Documenting Sources” (pp. 776-796).
